1)
Place these files in the same folder level as level03.tmx:
rule1.tmx
rules.txt

2)
In level03.tmx, copy all tiles of the "doodads helper" layer. This layer is kept hidden so you need to unhide it (CTRL + h) before you can see the tiles you need to copy.

3)
Paste the tiles copied in step 2 over the tiles of the "doodads" layer.

4)
Activate AutoMap by selecting Map -> AutoMap or using the key command CTRL + m.
